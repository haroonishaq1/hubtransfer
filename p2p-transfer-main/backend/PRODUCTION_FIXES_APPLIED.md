# Production Database Connection Fixes for Render.com

## Issue Summary
The p2p-transfer application was experiencing endless "📊 DB Query attempt 1/3" retry loops in production on Render.com, causing database connection failures and application instability.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Invalid PostgreSQL Pool Configuration**: Using `statement_timeout` and `query_timeout` as pool options (these are client-side settings, not pool options)
2. **Faulty Retry Logic**: Every single database query was triggering retry attempts, even for SQL errors
3. **Excessive Retries**: 3 retry attempts for every query, including non-connection errors
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Undefined error messages in connection monitoring

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Optimized Database Pool Configuration
```javascript
// Render.com optimized settings
max: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 3 : 8,  // Reduced from default 10
min: 0,  // Don't hold idle connections
connectionTimeoutMillis: 15000,  // Increased for network delays
keepAlive: true,  // Detect broken connections
```

### 2. Smart Retry Logic - Connection Errors ONLY
- **Before**: Every query triggered retry logging and attempts
- **After**: Only actual connection errors (ECONNRESET, ENOTFOUND, ETIMEDOUT, ECONNREFUSED) trigger retries
- **Reduced Retries**: From 3 attempts to 2 attempts maximum
- **SQL Errors**: No retries for constraint violations, syntax errors, etc.

### 3. Eliminated Endless Loops
- **Before**: `queryWithRetry` called itself recursively
- **After**: Direct `pool.query` usage with connection-specific retry wrapper
- **Result**: No more endless "📊 DB Query attempt X/Y" messages for every query

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
```javascript
// Fixed undefined error messages
const errorMessage = err?.message || 'Unknown connection error';

// Connection monitoring with reset mechanism
if (connectionAttempts >= MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    connectionAttempts = 0;
  }, 60000); // Reset after 1 minute
}
```

## Expected Production Results

### Before Fixes (Render.com Issues)
```
📊 DB Query attempt 1/3
❌ DB Query attempt 1 failed: [connection error]
📊 DB Query attempt 2/3
❌ DB Query attempt 2 failed: [connection error]
📊 DB Query attempt 3/3
❌ DB Query attempt 3 failed: [connection error]
[This pattern repeated endlessly for every query]
```

### After Fixes (Expected Behavior)
```
// Normal queries: No retry logging at all
// Connection issues only:
🔄 Connection issue detected, attempting smart retry...
🔄 Connection retry 1/2 due to: Connection reset
✅ DB Query succeeded on retry attempt 2
```

## Deployment Instructions for Render.com

1. **Push these changes to your repository**
2. **Render.com will auto-deploy** the updated configuration
3. **Monitor logs** for the absence of endless retry messages
4. **Verify** that upload/download operations work smoothly

## Monitoring Points

- ✅ No more "📊 DB Query attempt X/Y" logs for normal operations
- ✅ Connection retries only happen for actual network issues
- ✅ SQL errors fail immediately without retries
- ✅ Database pool uses optimized settings for Render.com

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/config/database.js` - Main database configuration
2. `/backend/server.js` - Health check endpoint
3. `/backend/.env` - Environment configuration
4. `/backend/setup-database.js` - Database initialization
5. `/backend/test-db-connection.js` - Connection testing

The fixes specifically target the Render.com production environment issues and should eliminate the endless retry loops that were causing application instability.
